# Data-Analytics-Approach-to-the-Cyber-Crime-Underground-Economy
“Data analytics project analyzing a synthesized cybercrime underground economy CSV dataset. It explores crime categories, attack patterns, geographic distribution, financial impact, and time-based trends using data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations in Python to derive actionable insights.”
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Data Analytics approach to understanding the Cyber Crime Underground Economy using a synthesized cybersecurity CSV dataset. The goal is to analyze hidden cybercrime activities, identify patterns, and understand their economic and geographical impact through data-driven techniques.
The analysis focuses on crime categories, attack methods, regions involved, financial impact, and temporal trends using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.

🎯Project Objectives:

Analyze cyber crime activities present in the underground economy

a)Identify dominant crime and attack categories
b)Study geographical distribution of cybercrime incidents
c)Understand revenue and financial loss patterns
d)Observe year-wise trends in cybercrime growth
e)Generate meaningful insights using data analytics

📂 Dataset Description

File Name: cybersecurity_large_synthesized_data.csv
Type: Structured CSV dataset
Nature: Synthesized data modeled on real-world cybercrime scenarios.


Dataset Contains (may vary slightly):
a)Crime or attack categories
b)Attack types or vectors
c)Country or region information
d)Year or time-based fields
e)Revenue or financial loss values
f)Incident or record identifiers
The dataset is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes.
